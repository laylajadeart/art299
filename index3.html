<h1> About Me </h1>
<body>
<h2> Hey, there! my name is Layla Beckner and I am an artist living in southern Maine.  </h2>
<h2>I enjoy multimedia art and work with medias such as pastels (oil and soft), acrylic paint, watercolor, charcoal and graphite, glass, found objects, and my personal favorite, a camera!</h2>
<h2> Some things I love are cats (I have 5), clothing, makeup, spending time oudoors, and taking photos. I am constantly learning how to edit my photos and new ways to make art. </h2>
<h2> In 2023, my painting was chosen to be displayed in the Portland Museum of Art for Youth Art Month. A work I wasn't proud of was going to be put in, so on a time crunch, I created a painting I liked much better. </h2>
 <h2> My work has also been displayed in an art show for the Westbrook Women's Club, and in the future, I'd love if my art was displayed elsewhere, too. </h2>
<h2> I pride myself on the time, effort, thought, and creativity that I put into my artworks. One day, I hope to be a photojournalist, documenting events suchs as protests, social events, and nature. I'd also love to do senior photos, wedding/elopement photography, pet/human portraits, and fashion/magazine photography!  </h2> </body>
